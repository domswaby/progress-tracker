This is your first group project!  Congratulatios on making it this far.  This project will test your basic Java, SQL, Agile, and Git competencies.  

One person needs to set up the empty Java Project and commit it and push it to the main branch on GitHub.

Then everyone should create and work on their own branches.  Follow the guidance from class on using Git and GitHub for collaberative coding.

Please adhere to the points below as well as the prompts: </br>

<ul>
  <li>Team Members are fixed.  Team leads can be changed once on Day 1, and you must let your instructor know of any changes.</li>
  <li>Give yourself a Team Name!</li>
  <li>Choose from the topic options, and let your intructor know by Day 1.</li>
  <li>You can use Zoom breakout rooms for work during class hours, and any chat options you like to communicate in addition.</li>
  <li>Class still starts and stops at the same time, on your indicated Zoom line.</li>
</ul>
</br>
**Submission:** </br>
This a group project.  There is only 1 submission per group.  Make sure all code contributions make their way into the main branch, as that is what will be used for grading.

Remember, the product presentation is the majority of your grade!

Happy coding!
